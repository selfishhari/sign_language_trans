Working towards converting text/audio to Indian sign language videos

## Some Best Practices for New Collaborators:
1. Never commit/push to master branch(I have created autoreject rule for pushes to master. Needs to happen only through pull request).
2. Always create a branch from development, once your changes are done, always create a pull request to development.
3. Only after everything is allright in development, create a pull request to master from development only.
4. Changes will be committed to master/development after someone reviews it. So assign reviewers to your pull requests.
5. But apart from these 2 branches please live your life as you want in your own branches ;)  No judgements...

##### Please add all the research papers that's relevant in references folder
